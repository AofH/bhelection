      Hi, my name is William Ridder and this is my entry for the data visualization challenge proposed by BitHound after completing their first challenge.
      I figured that since you guys want a full stack javascript developer, I'd show my skills here. This runs on node.js and express with a mongo database 
      storing the data that you provided. I used mongoinsert to get the csv into the database. First time using mongo, it's not overly hard to setup and use
      which was nice. For the visualizations, I used d3.js for everything, once again the first time using. This was more complex but once it sinks in, its not bad.
      One of the skills that I value is being able to learn quickly which is coming in handy for this project.

    <div class="intro-text">
      The map was a cool thing to build. I grabbed a .shp file from the internet of canada and its provinces. I used GDAL's ogr2ogr to convert the file into .json 
      and then used topojson.js to convert it to the topojson format used by d3. Since the majority of the province names in the canadaTopo.json file were the same 
      as the ones used in the election csv, I only had to convert two of the names to the correct value via javascript. The table being generated was done via 
      javascript as well. I regret not using a DOM data-binding tool a little, but I think for something small like this, the way I approached building it was fine.

    <div class="intro-text">
      Random Stuff came about when I was sleeping and woke up with an idea to try out different things other than the standard presentation of data.
      The explosions were interesting and I coded it when I couldn't sleep anymore. They grab the total votes by parliamentary group for the selected province and 
      resize the explosions according to the total. It turned out okish I think, not something very useful but fun.
    </div>
    <div class="intro-text">
      I also created a game for random stuff using Phaser.js as the game framework. I am familiar with Phaser as I have been doing some exploratory programming with 
      it to see if I can create a certain style of game. Its a small shooting game where your opponents health and name are set from the database. It grabs the top 20
      elected entrants and uses that as its data. Nunavut is easy with only 4 elected officials and low votes while Ontario is the hardest with the most votes and a full
      20. While I was debugging the program, it ran really really slow, but on production it seems to be fairly fast.
